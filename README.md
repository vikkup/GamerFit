# GamerFit
GamerFit is a website designed for young students with developmental problems.

As part of a study directed by Dr. April Bowling of the Health Science Department at Merrimack College, our team (Vikku Ponnaganti, Brian Boyle, and Kevin
Sampson) created a responsive website in Vue, a modern JavaScript framework. The purpose of the website was for the students involved in the study, whom 
have developmental disorders, to log in exercise records from exercise video games hosted on many gaming platforms like Playstation and Nintendo Switch.
